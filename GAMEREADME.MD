# OVERVIEW

This Line of code is important for I never knew how to code. Why I want to write this code is so that I can make games like this even apps.
So what I did is that of a survey and if else statements this helps programmers to give the choice to a user or computer by displaying it in the termial with the print function.

My purpose: Overall when I wrote this software is to learn how to become a better programmer learning the indentation and really have the know all to code.
