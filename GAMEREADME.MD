# OVERVIEW

This Line of code is important for I never knew how to code. Why I want to write this code is so that I can make games like this even apps.
So that I can become more profficent and actually excel at something that takes mental strength. My program is that of Pong the classic video hockey game that was one of the first games to come out in video game history. So just like hockey its a game that you hit back and forth to whoever reaches the highest score wins.

My purpose: Overall when I wrote this software is to learn how to become a better programmer learning the indentation and really have the know all to code.
